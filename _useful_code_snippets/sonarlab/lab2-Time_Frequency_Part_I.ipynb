There are many examples, including speech, music, and the sounds that surround you in daily life.  In this lab we will learn how to process these signals to determine how their spectrum changes with time.\n",

      "The basic problem is that we have long segment of a signal $x[n]$, where $n=0, ... ,N-1$.  We want to know what its frequency is as a function of time.  There are two basic approaches.  One is to pass the signal through a bank of bandpass filters, and plot the outputs of the filters as a function of time.  \n",

      "Since the frequency is changing, we want to break the signal into segments over which the frequency is relatively constant.  Then we will analyze each segment using the DFT.  The result of analyzing the first 256 samples, and another block of 256 samples that is 1024 samples later is shown in Figure 2.  As is the convention with the DFT, zero frequency is the first sample, and the Nyquist rate corresponds to the middle sample. The sampling rate in this example was 8192Hz, so the maximum frequency is 4096Hz. Note that the frequency has dropped about 300 Hz between the first and second block."

Instead, the most common presentation is to display the information in an image format, with frequency on the vertical axis, time on the horizontal axis, and the value of a particular pixel being the magnitude of the spectra at that time and frequency. For the first 4 tasks, we are assuming that the signal is real and the magnitude of the spectrum is symmetric about the origin.  We therefore need only display the positive frequencies.  Later, in task 5 where we acquire data using the SDR the signal is going to be complex and we will need to display both positive and negative frequencies.
