Step 1: Load the grid file into QGIS

In addition, I created a „Slope“ dataset using the QGIS toolbox to have three channels

Streb 2: Create a Virtual Raster Image (Raster-Misc-generate virtual_raster

Step3: Select the three grid files (or more…) as input channels

Step 4: Generate the file and save as GeoTif.

this is essentially a gdal command
